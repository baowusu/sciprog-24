# Practical 8

* This folder contains three fortran codes

## Compile

* gfortran gcd_random.f90 -o gcd
* gfortran -c gcd_random.f90 
* gfortran -c main.f90
* gfortran -o gcd main.o gcd_random.o

### First code should be compiled on its own. The rest need to compiled in the order of listing to ensure it is executable with ./gcd

## Execute

* ./gcd
  
### The executable ./gcd is used to execute all codes.
